<h2>Sponsor Application - 2025 5K-on-Wheels</h2>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our first-ever 5K-on-wheels! This fundraising event is in support of constructing Phase 2 of our local skate park, and we are excited that you'd like to be part of this event!<br /><br />This event is also a great opportunity to have your brand recognized as a community-minded organization supporting youth activity right here in Breckenridge. As an enduring supporter of the skate park, you will be recognized on the updated sign at the completion of phase 2, and all contributions add up to your total level of support!<br /><br />We are looking for sponsors at all levels for this event, so please contact us at <a href="mailto:twintownskatepark@gmail.com">twintownskatepark@gmail.com</a> if there's a way you'd like to support which isn't already listed below! Thank you!<br /><br />All sponsorship fees are considered a tax-deductible donation to the Twin Town Skate Park (c/o City of Breckenridge) and are therefore non-refundable, even in the event that the 5K-on-wheels is canceled. We will take reasonable measures to proceed with the 5K-on-wheels, but due to the outdoor nature of the event, severe weather circumstances may cause cancellation at the sole discretion of the Twin Town Skate Park Committee.</p>
