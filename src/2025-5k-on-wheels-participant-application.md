<h2>Twin Town Skate Park 2025 5K on Wheels - Participant Application</h2>
<div class="date-info-line"><div class="calendar-box"><p>Sep</p><p>22</p></div><p><b>Monday, September 22nd<br />5:00PM - 7:30PM</b></p></div>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our first-ever 5K-on-wheels! This fundraising event is in support of constructing Phase 2 of our local skate park, and we are excited that you'd like to be part of this event!<br /><br />This event is designed to promote healthy living and foster a sense of community. Unlike a traditional 5K, this event includes wheeled vehicles too! So Bikes, Skateboards, Rollerblades or Rollerskates, Scooters, and Strollers are all welcome!<br /><br /><u><b>No motor vehicles allowed!</b></u> Only vehicles that you propel yourself are permitted on some of the sidewalks and trails we'll be using for the event.<br /><br />Registration for the event is <u><b>open</b></u>, so please sign-up below! Early-bird registration includes a commemorative T-shirt from the event. We are only accepting early-bird registration <u>until September 5th</u>, after that you may still register for the event but your registration will not include a T-shirt.<br /><br />All registration fees are considered a tax-deductible donation to the Twin Town Skate Park (c/o City of Breckenridge) and are therefore non-refundable, even in the event that the 5K-on-wheels is canceled. We will take reasonable measures to proceed with the 5K-on-wheels, but due to the outdoor nature of the event, severe weather circumstances may cause cancellation at the sole discretion of the Twin Town Skate Park Committee.
